# 100-Day-Beginner-s-Algorithm-Introduction-Course
This project will record the process of a beginner mastering basic algorithms through 100 days of consistent check-ins. As a novice with only C++ programming fundamentals, I will spare 100 days out of the next 120 days to learn algorithms and clock in with algorithm problems (mainly elementary-level problems on LeetCode).
